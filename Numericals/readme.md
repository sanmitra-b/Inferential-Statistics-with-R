# Statistical Hypothesis Testing with R  
### Numericals – Data Science & Analytics

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to **formulate hypotheses, select appropriate statistical tests, implement them in R, and interpret results in real-world contexts**.  

The repository contains a curated set of **applied hypothesis testing problems**, covering:
- Proportions
- Means (z-tests & t-tests)
- Variance analysis (chi-square tests)
- Paired and independent samples

Each problem follows a **structured analytical workflow**, similar to what is expected in academic research, data analytics roles, and business decision-making.
